###Ackander's Vertical Tech Tree Editor###
=================

A tool for changing properties of [Ackander's Vertical Tech Tree](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60469-TechTree-0-23-Ackander-s-Vertical-Tech-Tree-Release-v1-15-45-c-Jan-11-2014) mainly which mods to include in the tree.

Currently very much in alpha but with most of the functionality there.

####Current features

* Automatically generates a tree based on what mods the user selects
* Editor tool for editing mod database including automated part discovery


####Planned features

* Automatically removes node chains that contain no parts unless other non-empty nodes depend on them


####Future features

* Ability to change other global settings on the tree, like science cost factor and science mod multiplier
* Ability to remove individual parts
* Possibly the ability to edit nodes directly (though we're getting into the reach of a full fledged Tree Editor here in that case, might be outside the scope of this application)
